          I started my journey trying to help businesses get seen, only to learn that visibility creates opportunity, but structure creates success. Now, I operate at the intersection of culture, capital, and community. My primary goal is building the infrastructure that allows brands to enter new markets and founders to scale without losing themselves in the process.
